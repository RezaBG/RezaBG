## Who I Am

I'm a backend-focused developer with 3+ years of experience building real-world systems using Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and AWS.  
I specialize in scalable API design, asynchronous data processing, and backend architecture.  
Recently, I’ve been extending my work into Go (Gin) for performance-critical services.

I specialize in:
- Python (FastAPI, Pydantic, CLI tools)
- Go (Gin framework, backend performance and concurrency)
- DevOps (Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions, CI/CD)
- React, React Native, TypeScript, Next.js
- Clean architecture, role-based access control (RBAC), asynchronous systems
- Building production-grade Python packages
